# LibrarySystem
 #### This is my first project in object oriented programming course 
 #### It is a simple library system through which books can be borrowed and keep track of existing books
 ###  
 * This program demonstrates the Book , Library , and Processes classes. It is a
 * library system that allows students to search in different ways for a
 * specific book and borrow books, and it allows to the librarian to add and
 * delete books, also to show all books in the library store
